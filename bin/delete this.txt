give me a dataset as a csv file for how sri lanka's kandy reagon's temperature,humidity and light level 
would change 
once a month data should be gathered 
finally their should be 36 data points (3*12)

  	    January				February				March				April				May				June				July				August				September				October				November				December				
 	    week 1	week 2	week 3	week 4	week 5	week 6	week 7	week 8	week 9	week 10	week 11	week 12	week 13	week 14	week 15	week 16	week 17	week 18	week 19	week 20	week 21	week 22	week 23	week 24	week 25	week 26	week 27	week 28	week 29	week 30	week 31	week 32	week 33	week 34	week 35	week 36	week 37	week 38	week 39	week 40	week 41	week 42	week 43	week 44	week 45	week 46	week 47	week 48	week 49

i wrote this example table for only 1 year, but u should give it for me to 3 years time frame


in this table mentioned something called 'vine1 vine2 vine3 vine4', this r Vanille vines.here r more details about Vanille vine
this is a dataset about a Vanilla farm in sri lanka's kandy reagon
in this project we farm a vanilla farm with 4 vanilla vines.and then we r gatheing a data about vanilla vines growth rate (Lenght & No of leave) alone with envirement facts (temperater, humidity, light level) within a 3 years time frame
create dataset's temperater, humidity and light level data as relevent to sri lanka's kandy reagon's envirmemt data 
when comes to 4 vanilla vine's growth rate, i have the venilla vine's start and end mesurements. (i gave them below table)
